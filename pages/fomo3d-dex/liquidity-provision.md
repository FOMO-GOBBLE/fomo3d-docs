# Liquidity Provision on FOMO3D

## How to Provide Liquidity

1. **Select a Pool**: Choose a trading pair you're interested in.
2. **Deposit Tokens**: Add an equal value of both tokens in the pair to the pool.
3. **Receive LP Tokens**: In return, you'll get liquidity provider tokens representing your share.

## LP Token Dynamics

- **Bonding Curve**: Early liquidity providers get more LP tokens for their deposit, incentivizing early participation.
- **Rewards and Fees**: You earn a portion of the trading fees based on your liquidity share.

## Incentives

- **Early Liquidity Rewards**: Higher returns for early funders due to the bonding curve.
- **Fee Sharing**: Collect trading fees proportional to your LP token ownership.

NOTE: Providing liquidity can involve risks like impermanent loss, especially in volatile markets.
