FOMO3D's Automated Market Maker (AMM) or DEX, introduces unique mechanics to enhance DeFi trading:

- **Dual Curve System**: Combines traditional constant product with a dynamic bonding curve for liquidity incentives.
- **Flat Fee Structure**: Aims at making large trades more cost-effective while reducing MEV impact.

## Key Concepts

- **Liquidity Pools**: Users add tokens to pools to facilitate trading.
- **Swaps**: Exchange one token for another within the pools.
- **Liquidity Provider (LP) Tokens**: Earned by adding liquidity, these represent your share in the pool's fees and rewards.
