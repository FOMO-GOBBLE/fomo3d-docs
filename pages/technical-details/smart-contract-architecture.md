# Smart Contract Architecture of Snapper

Snapper's architecture is built to optimize liquidity management, trade execution, and user engagement through innovative on-chain features. The design focuses on efficient operations and dynamic reserve balancing.

## Key Features

### Liquidity Management
- **Seamless Deposits:** 
  - Liquidity contributions are validated and processed to ensure pool integrity.
  - Both virtual and real reserves are updated in tandem, enabling precise liquidity tracking.
  - Liquidity Provider (LP) tokens are minted to represent a contributor's share.
  
- **Efficient Withdrawals:**
  - The system verifies pool conditions and liquidity availability promptly.
  - Virtual reserve states are recalibrated to ensure accurate withdrawal amounts.
  - LP tokens are burned to reflect liquidity removal, with assets transferred back securely.

### Trade Execution
- **Robust Swap Mechanism:**
  - Supports both buy and sell operations, automatically adapting to user intent.
  - Utilizes high-precision virtual reserve calculations to derive market-responsive pricing.
  - Applies configurable flat-rate fees while updating both reserve types to maintain core invariants.

### Underlying Technologies
- **Dynamic Reserve Management:** 
  - Virtual reserves are optimized for precise pricing and slippage control.
  - Real reserves mirror on-chain token balances to maintain liquidity constraints.
- **Configurable Parameters:**  
  - On-chain fee and liquidity settings are administrable via governed transactions.
- **Anchor Framework Integration:**  
  - Leverages Solana's Anchor framework for robust, secure, and efficient smart contract operations.
