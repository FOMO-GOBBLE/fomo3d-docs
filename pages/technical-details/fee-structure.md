# Fee Structure in Gobbler (F8M3)

## Core Fee System
- Implements innovative flat-rate fee structure
- Contrasts with conventional percentage-based DEX models
- Designed to benefit larger trades and reduce proportional costs

## Fee Distribution Components
Three distinct fee destinations:
1. Liquidity Provider Fees
   - Redeemable through LP tokens
   - Value appreciates with accumulated fees

2. Protocol Fees
   - Configurable percentage
   - Designed for platform sustainability

3. Creator Fees
   - Configurable percentage
   - Supports ongoing development

## Market Integration
- Currently integrated with Jupiter Aggregator
- Routes larger trades through platform due to lower fees

## Fee Rate Recommendations
1. Established Pairs (74% of analyzed volume)
   - Optimal range: 30,000-40,000 token units
   - Examples: SOL-USDC, SOL-JLP pairs

2. Volatile Pairs (26% of analyzed volume)
   - Recommended range: 1-5 million token units
   - Higher rates justified by increased impermanent loss risk
