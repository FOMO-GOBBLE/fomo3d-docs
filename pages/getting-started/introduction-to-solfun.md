# Introduction to SOLFUN

SOLFUN is a multifaceted platform on the Solana blockchain that serves both as a **decentralized exchange (DEX)** and a **memecoin launchpad**. It's designed to revolutionize liquidity provisioning and trading through an innovative automated market maker (AMM) model. "Snapper", tackles the challenges of capital efficiency, impermanent loss, and fee structures in decentralized finance (DeFi) by implementing:

- **A unique constant product curve with virtual liquidity**
- **A flat-rate fee system**

This combination not only aims to provide a more efficient and user-friendly trading environment but also facilitates the creation and launch of new memecoins, fostering a vibrant ecosystem for both trading and meme-driven projects.

## Why SOLFUN?

- Flat-rate fee system, whereas other DEX's charge a percentage fee. This makes SOLFUN the cheapest swaps on Solana.
- Unique revenue share model, where holders of $SOLFUN, $INFO and Mages NFT's receive a share of the fees generated.
- Memecoin launchpad where where tokens are auto-bonded and launched on the DEX shortly after.
