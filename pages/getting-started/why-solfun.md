# Why SOLFUN?

- Flat-rate fee system, whereas other DEX's charge a percentage fee. This makes SOLFUN the cheapest swaps on Solana.
- Unique revenue share model, where holders of $SOLFUN, $INFO and Mages NFT's receive a share of the fees generated.
- Memecoin launchpad where where tokens are auto-bonded and launched on the DEX shortly after.
