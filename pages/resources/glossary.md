# Glossary

- **Bonding Curve**: A mathematical curve determining token pricing based on supply, incentivizing early liquidity providers.

- **CLMM (Constant Liquidity Market Maker)**:

A CLMM (Concentrated Liquidity Market Maker) is a more advanced variant of an AMM. It allows liquidity providers to concentrate their liquidity within specific price ranges rather than across every price point. This means liquidity is used more efficiently where most trading occurs.

Key differences include:
* Concentrated Liquidity: Providers can choose a price range where they want to allocate liquidity. This results in deeper liquidity and lower slippage within that range because the funds are "concentrated" there.
* Improved Capital Efficiency: Since most liquidity is concentrated near the current trading price, capital is used more efficiently, allowing for larger trades with reduced price impact.
* Increased Complexity: The CLMM model often requires more sophisticated tracking of liquidity distribution (using data structures like tick arrays and virtual reserves) to manage the variable concentration of liquidity.

- **DEX (Decentralized Exchange)**: An exchange platform where users can trade directly without a central authority.
- **Impermanent Loss**: The potential loss in value liquidity providers might experience due to price volatility.
- **LP Token**: Liquidity Provider Token, given to users who add liquidity to a pool, representing their share.
- **Memecoin**: A type of cryptocurrency often created for fun or satire, typically inspired by memes or popular culture.
- **Slippage**: The difference between the expected price of a trade and the price at which the trade is executed.
- **Vesting**: A schedule by which tokens are distributed over time to prevent immediate dumping and encourage long-term holding.
