## Revenue Share

Solana.fun redistributes 95% of fees to stakers across three assets:

  * $SOLFUN token (69% of fees): The primary ecosystem token.
  * $MAGE NFTs (25% of fees): The official Solana.fun NFT collection.
  * $INFO token (1% of fees): The official dog of the Solana.fun!

  The remaining 5% is used for team operations, marketing, and CEX listings. Fees are proportionally redistributed to stakers of $SOLFUN, Mage NFTs, and $INFO. Stakers can claim their share of fees in SOL periodically.

* **What is the SOLFUN Launchpad?**

The SOLFUN Launchpad is a platform that simplifies memecoin creation on Solana

To launch a token:

1. Visit https://www.solana.fun/launch/

2. Provide the token name, ticker, description and image

3. Once created, your token must reach 85 SOL liquidity to bond and be listed on Snapper

* **Can anyone launch a project?**
  * Projects must complete the Create Your Own Token form to create their project token which is self-service. See [Launching a Project](../../solfun-launchpad/launching-a-project.md).

* **How can I support new memecoins?**
  * Projects are listed on our platform; you can support during their pre-bonding launch phase. [Supporting Projects](../../solfun-launchpad/supporting-projects.md) provides guidance.

## Liquidity Pools & Snapper DEX

* **What is the Snapper DEX?**

Snapper is a DEX in the Solana.fun ecosystem that enable low-cost memecoin trading.

Snapper provides a more familiar model for professional liquidity providers (LPs), focusing on established pairs (e.g., SOL/USDC) without bonding curves.

Both DEXs offer low fees and a chance to earn fees on any token pair. Earlier LPs benefit from larger fee shares and potential token value appreciation.

* **What is the fee model for Gobbler and Snapper?**

Snapper operates with a novel constant fee model:

  * 50% of fees go to liquidity providers (LPs).
  * 47.75% goes to stakers.
  * 2.25% goes to the team.

There are no fees for creating pools or providing liquidity.

* **How can I set up new liquidity pools or provide liquidity on Snapper DEX?**

This feature is currently being rolled out. More information will be available soon.

* **When will Snapper liquidity pools be integrated into Jupiter?**

Further details will be shared soon.
