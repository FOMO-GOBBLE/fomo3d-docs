2. **Marketing and Community Engagement**:
   - Shill your token on the Unofficial Fomo Launchpad Telegram channel. The Solana.fun team does not actively manage this channel, all management is led and supported by the community. [Contact and Support](../contact-and-support.md)

3. **Listing and Launch**:
   - Solana.fun is currently developing auto-bonding and pool creation for projects that launch. If your tokenâ€™s SOL pair is not listed on the Liquidity pools page, you will need to manually create a pool. If there are any issues, reach out to the Solana.fun team through Telegram.
