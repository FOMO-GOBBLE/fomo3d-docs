# CFMM Implementation in FOMO3D

FOMO3D's Constant Function Market Maker (CFMM) uses:

- **Formula**: `x * y = k^2`, where `x` and `y` are token reserves, and `k` is a constant.

## Bonding Curve Mechanics

- **Dual Curve**: `k^2 * k'^2 = α`, where `k'` is dynamic based on liquidity timing, and `α` is a constant.
- **Liquidity Incentives**: Early providers receive more LP tokens, incentivizing timely liquidity addition.

## Implementation Details

- **Deposit/Withdraw**: Calculated to balance the pool's constant product while adjusting for the bonding curve.
- **Price Impact**: Automatically calculated based on the amount of tokens swapped relative to pool size.

This approach aims to optimize liquidity provision, reduce impermanent loss, and encourage long-term liquidity stability.
